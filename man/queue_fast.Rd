\title{Faster version of \code{queue_step} with reduced functionality.}
\usage{
queue_fast(arrival_df, Number_of_servers = 1, service)
}
\arguments{
\item{arrival_df}{A dataframe with column names ID and times . The ID column is a key
for the customers. The times column is of class \code{numeric} and represents the
arrival times of the customers.}

\item{Number_of_servers}{The number of servers in the queue model. It is only possible to set the number of servers, not a resource schedule.}

\item{service}{A vector of service times with the same ordering as arrival_df.}
}
\value{
A vector of response times for the input of arrival times and service times.
}

Faster version of \code{queue_step} with reduced functionality.
