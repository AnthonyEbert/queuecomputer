Authors@R: as.person("Anthony Ebert <anthonyebert@gmail.com>[aut, cre]")
Description: Computes the output times for queues with arbitrary arrival
    and service times. The package is referred to as "queuecomputer" rather
    than "queuesimulator" since the emphasis in this package is computing
    *deterministically* the output times for arbitrary pre-simulated arrival and
    service times.
